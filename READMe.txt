Hello! Welcome to my Project 1.
This is an HTML Minecraft Adventure Game.
To play, visit the html-adventure-homework folder, and open index.html.
Within that folder will also be another readme file telling you your objective, but the game will lead you on your way.
To see my design flowchart and designdocument, visit the doc and image file.
